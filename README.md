# Table Cleanup
HTML Table editor that provides scoping and a visual editor so that the table meets Canada.ca web standards and WET Style guidelines.

## Instructions
* Open `table-cleanup.html`
* Once you copy the `<table>` code from your HTML source, paste it and overwrite the contents in the HTML Input box
* Press the Clean up button
* Click on cells within the Visual table to show the toolbar

## Known Issues
* Drag selection in the Visual table may not work when selecting a merged cell (cell with colspan > 1)
* When drag selecting, releasing the mouse outside the Visual table will not complete the drag selection. You **must** release within the Visual table
* Drag selection cannot deselect cells. You must click on a single cell to deselect it or press the Deselect all button in the toolbar
